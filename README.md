# Tadabor: Quran web App

This project is a web App that allows you to browse the Quran and write your notes/reflections below the verses, everything will be saved in your browser.

## How to use

Simply go to Quran Browser on the home page, you can click the button next to any verse to open a form where you can enter your text, and once you are done writing you can press the save button, all the data will be saved on your browser app and clearing your cache might erase the data you have saved.

## Disclaimer

The app is in beta, which means you may encounter occasional bugs.
We strongly recommend keeping a backup of any data you save while
using the app. Please be aware that the accuracy of the Quran roots
list has not been verified, and the completeness of search
results based on sentences or roots has not been extensively tested.
